# FeedBlok 🌐
Welcome to **FeedBlok**, your new project on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain! 🚀 By default, this README and some template files are included to help you get started. You can customize these files to fit your project needs and expedite your development cycle. 

Check out your live demo here: [FeedBlok Mainnet](https://ycybn-xyaaa-aaaap-ahdha-cai.icp0.io/) 🌍

## Getting Started

To kick things off, explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working within your development environment won't affect any production deployments or identity tokens. 🎯

### Useful Resources

Before diving in, you might find these resources helpful:

- 📘 [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- 🛠️ [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- 💻 [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- 📑 [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

### Essential Commands

Get started with your project using these commands:

```bash
cd feedblok/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the Project Locally 🖥️

To test your project locally, use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your Candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the deployment is complete, your application will be accessible at: `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

### Backend Updates

If you update your backend canister, generate a new Candid interface with:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This should be done before starting the frontend development server. Note that it runs automatically whenever you execute `dfx deploy`.

### Frontend Development

For frontend changes, start a development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will launch a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica on port 4943.

## Frontend Environment Variables 🌱

If hosting your frontend code outside of DFX, ensure it doesn't fetch the root key in production by:

- Setting `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if using Webpack
- Using a preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override` to a string in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
- Writing your own `createActor` constructor

Happy coding! 🚀
